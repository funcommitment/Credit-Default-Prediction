# Credit Default Prediction (2-Year Horizon)
This project builds a machine-learning model that predicts whether a borrower is likely to default within the next two years. The model outputs a probability of default, giving lenders a clearer sense of risk instead of a simple yes/no answer.

The dataset includes financial and behavioural features such as income, debt ratio, late-payment history, and credit usage. It also reflects real-world conditions with missing values, skewed data, and outliers.

The goal is to create a reliable credit-scoring model that helps identify high-risk borrowers early and supports better lending decisions.

This project uses the dataset from a Kaggle competition "Give Me Some Credit" ($5,000 prize) to build a credit scoring model.
